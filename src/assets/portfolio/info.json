The server was built with dot NET and had a wide range of functionality from end-to-end message encryption and delivery to cryptographically secure game result generation. It was made to be flexible as it needed to support many different clients and configurations. For example, in some setups it would provide simulated roulette results while in others it would manage a physical roulette. Given the massive scope required by the server it was all founded on a extremely modular design allowing for flexible extensibility.",

Later when the project was upgraded to Haxe I ported the shader program to the OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL), which was far easier to accomplish.",

For our particular use case, we needed the streams to be very flexible in presentation as well as extremely low latency since they were used to broadcast results in a casino environment. After spending much time researching solutions and playing around with various protocols, such as Adobe's RTMFP, I settled on using WebRTC for performance reasons. The server handled state synchronization with SocketIO and acted as a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) using a library called MediaSoup. Being an SFU it was designed to handle an arbitrary amount of clients and spread the workload intelligently across as many processes as was required. The client side application was built with Electron in order to be able to have complete customization of the window. The client could be configured in numerous ways from kiosk mode to a small overlay and could either produce or consume a stream.",

Since the scope of the project was meant to be fairly small, and since WebRTC streaming over the internet requires more advanced mechanisms (STUN, TURN servers), the application only works within a local network. Unfortunately, because of this constraint there is no easily accessible demo. One has to manually setup the Node server and sideload the APK on multiple android devices to test it out.",
